1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello and welcome to this course overview

2
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:06,266
presentation for EVPC 321.

3
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:09,833
My name is Bruce Brazel,
along with Megan O'Connell.

4
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:14,700
We were the faculty assigned
to creating this course.

5
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,900
In this course,
you're going to be designing a solution

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,900
to take on an environmental challenge,
and you're going to be learning

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,933
about a approach to project planning
known as the logical frameworks.

8
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:32,900
So your course project
will involve these broad things.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,400
Selecting a community
based environmental issue to tackle

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,400
planning a strategic initiative

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,066
to address the issue
using the logical framework approach.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,300
And then finally,

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,233
you will create a project blueprint
that will bring a lot of pieces together.

14
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:54,033
So you'll have a cohesive plan to address
your chosen issue.

15
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:58,800
Now, there are a number of different kinds
of scenarios that you can take

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,733
to become the focus
of your course project.

17
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:06,300
The environmental issue
that you're choosing to explore

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,333
to give you a leg up on this.

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Doctor O'Connell has created

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,533
three broad scenarios,

21
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,900
that deal with the three

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,900
big themes of this course.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,233
The first is conservation.

24
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:27,466
So in scenario one, it
focuses on endangered

25
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:31,100
species
conservation in San Francisco Bay area.

26
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,566
The second theme is sustainability.

27
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:37,833
So scenario
two is environmental sustainability

28
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:41,600
in agriculture
and in business is Missouri.

29
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:47,433
And the third theme is regulatory
compliance and environmental justice.

30
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:50,566
So this particular scenario

31
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:54,200
is played out
in the petrochemical industry

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,800
and its impact on the folks
that live in the Houston, Texas region.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,333
Now, you're not limited to these three,
but if you read through these scenarios,

34
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:09,733
you will see that there are different
options for you to, export.

35
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:15,533
You're definitely welcome to pick
a scenario that you find very interesting

36
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:19,400
that you're very passionate about,
to explore which project.

37
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:23,100
So here's our roadmap
to completing the course

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,100
project for EPC 321.

39
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:30,933
Our first step in week one will be
the creation of an annotated bibliography.

40
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:34,833
In week two
you will define the goals of the project.

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,500
The indicate errors
and the means of verification.

42
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,733
In week three,
you'll refine your project and populate,

43
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:46,633
the grid known as the log frame.

44
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,233
In week four,
you will construct your project Brief,

45
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:55,833
which will be a more detailed,
fleshed out components describing

46
00:02:55,833 --> 00:03:01,266
the different aspects of your project
and the interested and effective persons,

47
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,200
the community that are going to benefit
or need to support your project.

48
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,933
And the final submission
is the Project Blueprint, which brings

49
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,866
all these components together.

50
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:16,233
So the annotated bibliography is basically

51
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:19,966
you're going to be selecting your course
project issue this week.

52
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,766
You're going to be conducting
a strategic literature search

53
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:29,766
to familiarize yourself with the topic
when you're not an expert in this field.

54
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:33,566
So we're going to be relying on
what has been published

55
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:38,766
previously by the experts,
and that is going to help

56
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:43,200
inform the different aspects
of your project development.

57
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,100
In week two,
we will be refining the project

58
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,833
goals, the indicators
and the means of verification.

59
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,166
So you're going to dive deeper in
to some of the items

60
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,800
you found in your previous review
of the literature in week one,

61
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,833
so this can help you develop your research
and foreign project goals.

62
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:06,266
The indicators or metrics,
those are going to be the measures

63
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:11,000
of progress and the success of the project
and the means of verification,

64
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:14,800
which is what is going to be measured
and how it's going to be measured.

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,566
The technology that's involved.

66
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:22,266
In week three,
you will populate your log frame.

67
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:25,900
So we'll be walking you
through that process.

68
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,633
So all the elements that you've collected
so far for weeks one and two,

69
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,100
that's going to pour into helping you

70
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,833
to build out your structured project plan.

71
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,000
And week four is the project brief,
where you're going to synthesize

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,033
what you've learned from the literature
and the development of your project plan

73
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:50,366
to create a very cohesive project,
narrative and justification

74
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:54,266
for addressing
this chosen environmental issue.

75
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:57,400
And then the final submission
is the project blueprint,

76
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,266
which is the culminating, task
in this course.

77
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:05,633
So it will consist of a title page, a
table of contents, annotated bibliography,

78
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:10,166
detailed description of the goals,
indicators and means of verification.

79
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,200
The log frame table, the project brief,
and of course, you will support it with,

80
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,233
an appendix with references
and the feedback table.

81
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:21,033
And the feedback table is going to be

82
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:24,633
a critical component of this
because one of the aspects of project

83
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:29,466
planning is involving your community,
involving stakeholders, involving

84
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:33,600
am interested
in effective persons or people.

85
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:38,533
And so while we are not actually
in the field

86
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:41,933
building your particular project,

87
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:46,000
we're going to simulate
that feedback, network

88
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:49,933
by the feedback
that your instructor is going to provide

89
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,566
you and the feedback that your peers in
the course are going to provide, you.

90
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,233
And the very last thing
that you will submit for this

91
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:57,766
course will be a presentation.

92
00:05:57,766 --> 00:06:04,100
So you will create a video in which
you will pitch your plan to the community.

93
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,500
So not only you're going to be providing
details on what the project is about

94
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,400
and what it aims to do, but you're also
going to have to cover the why.

95
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:15,900
Because one of the things
that you will encounter in the real world

96
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:20,866
is you're going to need the community
behind you to support your project

97
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,666
and to continue
to support the project for its duration.

98
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:30,433
So that's a quick overview
of the course project for PC 321.

99
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:35,666
If you have any further questions,
please reach out to your instructor.
